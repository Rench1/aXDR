# ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/OTtNhTo.png) jXDR CMS 
##### Version Alpha 7.0.0
##### Rodolfo Contreras (Mr.M) - Arctic Development

### Getting Started
> jXDR CMS is a fresh from scratch Emulation website which emulates HabboWEB in a different style. **jXDR** stands for Javascript XDR Content Management System. Although this project is pretty different to the original version created by **Boris Akopov**, the fundamental idea of **XDR** has not changed. **XDR** WEB offered a better system that could overlap other projects with modern technologies and functions. Right now jXDR is divided into two parts: *aXDR WEB App* **(FrontEnd)** & *aXDR API* **(Backend)**. This repository is only for jXDR WEB App made in angular.

### Features
+ jXDR WEB App is currently working under *Angular 8*.
+ jXDR API is currently working under *ExpressJS*
